API using DRF

# Description
Reddit clone allows users to create authenticated accounts which allow the creation of posts. Posts can be created, edited and destroyed by authenticated user. ReadOnly 
functionality is used so that non account owners can view posts. Posts can also be upvoted. 

# Project Status
I will have to implement the front end portion of this project. Right now I'm mainly focusing on creating API endpoints so that I can become good at it.
